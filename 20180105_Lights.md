In my appartment we have remotes for our fan lights. I am trying to see if I can build something to integrate these into our "smart home" setup.

This is day 0 hour 0...

From our external visual analysis we see that the controller contains the following:
* 5 buttons (hi, med, lo, off, light)
* 1 indeicator LED (red)
* Label "Concord (R)"
* 1 philips screw on back
* FCC label
* Battery compartment (9V)

Now we have a decision, follow the FCC ID (I got this information from a DEF CON talk) or open the device via the battery compartment. We will do the battery compartment first.

The 9V battery is confirmed. Upon visual inspection we can see the entire cavity of the device. Inside we find the following:
* secondary hidden screw preventing opening of device
* QC sticker (PASSED, Dated 2016.06.)
* hand written markings that looks like apt number (hidden for privacy) and "Bed 1" (this is the room this specific controller is in)
* other hand written notes
* PCB (looks like single-sided through hole with about 10-20 components)
  * 18-pin DIP package
  * transistor
  * coil or antenna
  * other passives (resistors, caps, etc.)
  * 4 gang DIP switches (set to 0110)
  
Normally I would just go ahead and open this item up and do further PCB analysis but I am writing this from my bed currently and do not have a screwdriver. But the trail down this path is basically get model numbers of chips, get datasheets if possible, draw a schematic of the PCB, and eventually start testing voltages. I might go down this road another day.

For now I have just used my magnifier on my iPhone to get the chip number (HT-12E / B549G0518G3. There was another model number on the PCB but I did not feel like getting that yet.

Lets follow the chip number as it is probably the only active device on this board and will likely tell us all we need to know...

I did not know what the logo on the chip or HT model number was so I did a quick google search for HT-12E. This returned a link[http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1899539.pdf] to a datasheet with the name HOLTEK. I like to try to get my datasheets directly from the source so instead of using this DS from Farnell (an electronics retail/wholesaler) I will attempt to look up the DS on the HOLTEK site.

Googled holtek to find http://www.holtek.com/.

Found a helpful index at http://www.holtek.com/en/numindex. I will save this link for future holtek product searches. I checked the holtek site search and it did seem to return a datasheet too but the search result was named something odd. Luckily there were only 3 hits to scan through. Regardless back to the index link. This had a hit for the HT12E here[http://www.holtek.com/productdetail/-/vg/2_12e]. We will take a look at the product page first to get a general idea, then look in depth into the datasheet.

(P 1) DS says that this is a 2^12 series of encoders. It inputs 8 address bits and 4 data bits and sends them out via RF.
